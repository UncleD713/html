    <p>Since the start of this quarantine, like everyone else, I was working from home until my company made 
       the decision to furlough me along with thousands of fellow employees.  During this time, I decidded to 
       lay the ground work to return to college therefore I applied to Valencia College with an eye to start 
       classes in Fall 2020.  I started classes in Fall of 2020 to obtain a AS Degree in Digital Media with a 
       specialization in Web Development.  Also, during the quarantine, I got a chance to spend a great deal 
       of timetime with my family.  Lastly, I got the opportunity to improve my golf game during the quarantine
